## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Computer Science Engineering student** focused on building **strong fundamentals** in programming and problem-solving.

I don’t believe in shortcuts or fake titles.  
I’m learning things **properly**, step by step — writing clean code, breaking my own logic, fixing mistakes, and improving daily.

### What I’m actively working on:
- 🧠 **Python with Data Structures & Algorithms**
- 🌐 **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
- 🧩 Problem-solving & logic building
- 🛠️ Small but real-world beginner projects
- 📈 Writing better, cleaner, more readable code

I’m documenting my journey publicly to stay accountable and grow professionally.
